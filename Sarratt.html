	  <h2>Scotch Game: Scotch Gambit, Sarratt Variation</h2>
	    <section>
		  <p>One of my most played openings actually does not come from
		  me playing the scotch, I actually play the Giuoco Piano, and 
		  then I push the pawn to e4, also known as the Rosentreter Gambit.
		  Once black takes the e4 pawn with his pawn, then this transposes 
		  into the scotch gambit, haxo gambit. From here I could play c3, 
		  and go into another line, but for this opening I play Ng5!, immediately
		  applying pressure on the pawn near the king.
		  </p>
		  <p> 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d4 exd4 5. Ng5 </p>
		  <!--image of board position-->
		  <p> Black is forced to put his knight on the rim, or else the 
		  position will be difficult to deal with.</p>
		  <p> For example, if black continues with Ne5, we simply capture 
		  the weak pawn next to the king with the knight, 6. Nxf7!</p>
		  <p> The most natural thing to do here is to capture the knight, 
		  as the queen and rook have been forked. But then after a bunch 
		  of captures, (bishop recaptures knight, king captures bishop) 
		  then comes Qh5+, winning back the bishop, and another pawn 
		  on the next move (black has no way to protect its d4 pawn). 
		  <p>1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d4 exd4 5. Ng5 Ne5 6. 
		  Nxf7 Nxf7 7. Bxf7+ Kxf7 8. Qh5+ g6 9. Qxc5 d6 10. Qxd4 Nf6 </p>
		  <p>Stockfish says 6...Bb4+ as the top move, but after 
		  6. Nxf7 Bb4+ 7. c3 dxc3 8. bxc3 Nxf7 9. cxb4, white has a good position.</p>
