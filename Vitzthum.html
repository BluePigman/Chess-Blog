	    <h2> Scotch Game: Vitzthum Attack</h2>
		 <section>
		  <p> Continuing from the Sarratt Variation, after Black correctly plays Nh6, we
		  don't simply settle for the pawn, instead we add more pressure with 6. Qh5?!.
		  Stockfish doesn't like this move, but it is a move that has some traps. 
		  Let's start with a trap that ends the game in 2 moves from here! </p>
		  
		  <p> 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d4 exd4 5. Ng5 Nh6 6. Qh5</p>

		  <h3> A very quick checkmate (A natural move followed by a blunder) </h3>
		  
		  <p>There is clearly a lot of pressure on the f7 pawn. How can we add another defender
		  and play a natural developing move? Simply castling right? Most people seeing this
		  will castle, as your rook now defends the pawn and you get your king to safety (or do you?)
		  White now plays 7... Bxf7+. A huge mistake would be 8. Nxf7??, leading to 8... Qxh7#.
