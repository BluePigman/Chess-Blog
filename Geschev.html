	  	<h2>Alekhine Defense: Scandinavian Variation, Geschev Gambit</h2>
		<section>
			<h3>How did I even find this opening?</h3>
			<p>I had originally planned to play the Kadas Gambit in the Scandinavian, but when I played 2...Nf6,
				I found no one who would play d4. Instead, almost everyone played 3. Nc3 exclusively. So I decided 
				to play 3...c6 to keep the spirit of the gambit. Obviously I can take the pawn with the knight. 
			</p>
			<p>Turns out, this opening name comes from the Alekhine Defense, but from a transposition to the same 
				position.

				1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 c6
